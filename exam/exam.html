      ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that has been trained to generate human-like text. It is
      based on the GPT-3 architecture, which is a state-of-the-art language processing model that has been trained on a
      vast amount of text data. ChatGPT is capable of generating highly realistic and coherent text that can be used in
      a variety of applications,
      including chatbots, language translation, and content generation.
